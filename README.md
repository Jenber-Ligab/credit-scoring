Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview of the Data
Understand the structure of the dataset, including:
Number of rows
Number of columns
Data types for each feature
Summary Statistics
Calculate central tendency measures (mean, median) and dispersion metrics (standard deviation, variance).
Analyze the shape of the dataset’s distribution.
Distribution of Numerical Features
Visualize distributions using histograms or density plots to identify patterns, skewness, and potential outliers.
Distribution of Categorical Features
Analyze frequency counts and variability within categorical features using bar plots or pie charts.
Correlation Analysis
Assess relationships between numerical features using correlation matrices and heatmaps.
Identifying Missing Values
Identify missing values in the dataset to determine their impact and decide on appropriate imputation strategies.
Outlier Detection
Use box plots to visually identify outliers in numerical features.
Task 3 - Feature Engineering
Create Aggregate Features
Examples:
Total Transaction Amount: Sum of all transaction amounts for each customer.
Average Transaction Amount: Average transaction amount per customer.
Transaction Count: Number of transactions per customer.
Standard Deviation of Transaction Amounts: Variability of transaction amounts per customer.
Extract Features
Examples:
Transaction Hour: Hour when the transaction occurred.
Transaction Day: Day of the month when the transaction occurred.
Transaction Month: Month when the transaction occurred.
Transaction Year: Year when the transaction occurred.
Encode Categorical Variables
Convert categorical variables into numerical format using:
One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical values into binary vectors.
Label Encoding: Assigns a unique integer to each category.
Handle Missing Values
Options include:
Imputation: Filling missing values with mean, median, mode, or advanced methods like KNN imputation.
Removal: Removing rows or columns with few missing values.
Normalize/Standardize Numerical Features
Scaling techniques include:
Normalization: Scales data to a range of [0, 1].
Standardization: Scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Feature Engineering libraries used:
xverse

Task 4 - Modeling
Model Selection and Training
Split the Data
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
Choose Models
Select at least two models from:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
Train the Models
Train selected models on the training dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Enhance model performance through hyperparameter tuning using techniques like:
Grid Search
Random Search
Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using metrics such as:
Accuracy: Ratio of correctly predicted observations to total observations.
Precision: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to total predicted positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
F1 Score: Weighted average of Precision and Recall.
ROC-AUC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, measuring model's ability to distinguish between classes.
Conclusion
This README provides a comprehensive overview of the EDA and feature engineering processes applied in this project. By following these structured tasks, you can gain insights from your dataset and prepare it for effective modeling.
